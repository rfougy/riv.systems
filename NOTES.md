# My Dev Notes
## For Post Page:

- Adding Recommendations Component
- Adding next/prev post navigation

## Other:

- Have search feature work on mobile

## DisplayDots Animation:

The idea is to have the animation work with responsive design, where:
  a. the string can have flex wrap (requires segmenting the string into words)
  b. size can shrink and grow based on viewport

###### Notes to Self:
- find out how to work around nested mapping
- find out how to avoid rerendering for following approach 

#### Part 1: Refactoring, group coords by word

Refactor the current approach so that the grouped coords are grouped by word. This can be done by referencing grouped coords that are for spaces (a.k.a. custom split method).

#### Part 2: Approach to updating DotCell Styling

##### Context & deactivateCorods

1. Create context that stores the following states: 
  a. 'deactivatedCoords' (array)
2. In Component: setInterval every x milliseconds, select an inactiveCoord from inactiveCoords local state.
  i. Push inactiveCoord to deactivatedCoords context state.
  ii. In Contex (useEffect hook): remove the inactiveCoord from inactiveCoords local state. 
  iii. clearInterval once list of inactiveCoords local state is empty.

##### Updating Styles

1. In DotCell Component: Create a local state 'active' with type boolean.
2. In DotCell Styled Component: Create conditional styling logic based on active state.
3. In DotCell Component: have a useEffect that watches for changes in deactivatedCoords context state.
  i. If a change occurs, check if the last coord in the array matches the DotCell's coord. If it does, change the 'active' state to false.
