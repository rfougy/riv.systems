# My Dev Notes

## Refactoring:

- optimize section and content pages (filtering and pagination redundancy)

###### To-Do:

- use useMemo to avoid rerendering (see: https://alexsidorenko.com/articles)
- create placeholder image in scenario where user is offline
- have dots animation wrap
- remove category and section from frontmatter, refer strictly to slug whenever referencing caategory and/or section
- refactor: replacing any with strict types
