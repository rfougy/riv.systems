Who would have ever thought an opportunity like this could be possible?

The team and I at ARCHIVE.pdf have [worked with Adidas](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18008854915814606/) over the past 1-2 years, promoting their silhouettes and even covering their Y-3 show during Paris Fashion Week. Earlier this year, Adidas reached out to have us fly across the globe to Germany and visit their headquarters and archive—all expenses covered. I couldn’t attend due to personal matters, but man, I never believed lightening could strike twice until now.

Johnny, our Business Lead, and I arrived in the city of Nürnberg, Germany on a Wednesday morning. You wouldn’t expect for a world-class footwear brand to accommodate you in a seemingly random town, but its charm grew on us without us ever realizing, perhaps from our personal upbringings in the similarly small towns in Massachusetts. At Nürnberg's center stood a colossal cathedral Frauenkirche (a.k.a., the ‘Church of the Lady’), towering over a square of local vendors.

Not long after we arrived, more people invited by Adidas began trickling in one after the other. Founders from the likes of [Archived Dreams](https://www.instagram.com/archived.dreams/), [Hartcopy](https://www.instagram.com/hartcopy/), [Advanced Research](https://www.instagram.com/advanced.research/), [90’s Anxiety](https://www.instagram.com/90sanxiety/) and [Cabmate](https://www.instagram.com/cabmate/), editors from fashion and lifestyle magazines such as Hypebeast, and many more. This was truly an international play by Adidas, and it worked.

Around 8AM the next morning, our group was en route to Herzogenaurach, the city where Adidas is headquartered. Their campus is unfathomably large. The architecture is brutal yet welcoming, a corporate structure designed to foster creativity that extends beyond the bottom line (that’s my interpretation, at least).

Our group split into several smaller groups, with my group starting at Makerlab. [This article](https://www.shanemachir.com/adidas-makerlab) I stumbled upon describes Makerlab pretty well: “The adidas Makerlab was opened in 2016 to tap into the creative potential of all employees. For designers it’s a place where they can have access to the tools they need to innovate and craft their designs. Those outside of design come to expand their perspectives and benefit from learning creative processes that they can apply to their work.”

High-level leaders from the Adidas design team gave us a rundown on their new silhouettes and how they fit into Adidas footwear (no pun intended). Quick side note: I decided not to share these images in this blog post, as they’ll be featured in content by ARCHIVE.pdf very soon.

After Makerlab, we took a tour across the Adidas campus. This included impressively designed exhibitions that pulls its visitors into the brand’s rich history, from its inception to its accomplishments that span over the course of decades.

Last but not least was a tour of the Adidas Archive. Apparently, only a select few are allowed to enter, including the brand’s own employees. Their archivist brought us on a journey through the archives, showcasing everything from pivotal sneakers to the original models that inspired the newly released silhouettes. The archive tour lasted for about an hour—too little time in my opinion. Just imagine what’s hidden within the aisles of white boxes, stored in a temperature-controlled, sanitized space. I hope that our team can dig ever deeper in the near future.

This opportunity would have never presented itself if not for the team at ARCHIVE.pdf. The content team in particular go above and beyond in ensuring that the visual content, writing, and research are at the highest level of quality possible. And it shows.

Since the very beginning, ARCHIVE.pdf has been strictly comprised of volunteers: writers, content curators, archivists, designers, developers, managers. I’m not going to let our passion go to waste. We’re going to make it, and this trip marks the first of many steps in realizing this.
