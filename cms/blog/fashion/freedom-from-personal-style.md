The COVID-19 pandemic sparked a cataclysmic shift in the digital realm, changing life as we know it forever.

Cooped up within the clusters of apartment complexes and suburban neighborhoods lay humankind, afraid and deprived, retreating even further into the deepest crevices of the world wide web, in search of any semblance of belonging. Many found refuge in the bottomless pits of fashion—personas and trends abound—and from within cascaded an ever-radiant spectrum of style.

Fast forward to the present day, the means of expressing one’s self are infinite. The online fashion community found itself overwhelmed by this endless stream of possibilities, and so from the cesspool of micro-trends a conduit of hope was born: an anti-trend called personal style.

Everyone has their own definitions of personal style—funnily enough, this reveals a definition of its own: style that is personal to you. Within the context of fashion, however, the community has associated the term with an aspiration to express one’s “true self” to the world. But what happens when that same community numbs itself through lethal injections of micro-trends and looks to personal style as the cure?

Where trends perpetuate the vicious spirals of desire, personal style can inspire the opposite: mindful consumption, reflection, intention. One could proudly tout that this is a trend in the right direction—if only we weren't cursed by the insatiable thirst for more. We’ve misled ourselves into believing that the goal of personal style is something akin to self-actualization, with each piece of clothing we purchase bringing us one step closer. In reality, it’s a never-ending quest because we are ever-changing.

Many embark on the journey of personal style oblivious to the tragedy that has already befallen them, others embrace its paradoxical nature in all of its beauty, and fewer break free from this cycle that repeats itself like an snake eating its own tail. And with economic uncertainty polluting the air we breathe, the winding of this road has become evermore contorted.

In order to free yourself from the endless cycle of personal style, you must first understand the unassuming force that guides its movement: status.

For centuries, the upper echelons of humankind have ascribed social value unto objects, transforming meaningless forms of mass into aspirational status symbols that are worshipped and sought after by the masses. Status dictates both our quality of life and our esteem within micro and macro communities. Chasing status is a reward-seeking behavior that encourages future prosperity, with personal style playing an unexpected role in this pursuit.

If the eyes are the windows to the soul, appearance opens the door to one’s social standing. There’s symbolism woven into your choice of clothing based composition, cut, cost and culture—all are interpreted on a subconscious level to assess the amount of respect you’re worth. Status seeking helps spin the wheel of personal style, but as we become aware of its role in our decision-making, we can take the necessary steps to jump off the wheel altogether.

Most people start their journeys into personal style from the mainstream, and gradually flow into the downstream of subcultures; as they gain experience through exploration and experimentation, the layers of the fashion onion begin to peel away, revealing the cultural phenomenon as ripe to its core. After a certain point in one’s style progression, however, there may be diminishing returns:

Aesthetic eras turn into fine tuning with deadly precision, accessible clothing into unobtainable ‘grail pieces', casual browsing into the infinite scrolling of Discord servers, secondhand marketplaces and social media feeds. Suddenly you find yourself mimicking the protagonist of Fight Club: “[I had] a wardrobe that was getting very respectable. I was close to being _complete_.”

For some this isn’t considered an issue to begin with, but if you’re like me and want to break free, bend the line to your will:

Rarely is the case where fashion fanatics can imitate the graph above. But equip yourself with the right habits that practice mindful consumption and contentment, and you’ll find yourself bending this trajectory like wire.

## Make Your Wardrobe Versatile

Longtime fashion enthusiasts seldom discard consumerism in favor of self-contentment—and that’s ok. The key is to recognize when your wardrobe has become versatile enough to accommodate most occasions (e.g., social hangouts, running errands, formal events) and modes of expression (e.g., outgoing, lowkey, leisurely) across the status hierarchy.

The only caveat is time: time to make the necessary tweaks and rotations within your wardrobe, time to understand how you interface with the world through your outfits. It may take months, perhaps years, until your wardrobe reaches this state; once it does, you’ll be surprised at how few excuses you’ll have for bringing in new additions.

## Practice Appreciation Over Consumption

There is a reason for every item living in your wardrobe—some are sentimental, others reflective of who you are or want to become. Shift your focus from what you lack to what you have. By appreciating the present moment and all of the objects you’ve accrued thus far, their substance will resonate and reverberate through every outfit. And, ironically, staying in place catapults you along the progression of your personal style, skipping the trials and errors others trip over in this mischievous hobby.

## Wait and Contemplate

When at the cusp of purchasing a new item, wait and contemplate. Whether it’s a note-taking app or a journal, walk through your own reasoning and justifications first:

- **Wardrobe-based:** What gaps does this item fill within my own wardrobe? Is there an item in my wardrobe that conveys the same emotion or can be worn on similar occasions?
- **Motive-based:** Why do I really want this item? Is it because I genuinely believe that I’ll wear it for the foreseeable future, or because I’ll gain social clout for a fleeting moment in time?
- **Cost-based:** What makes up the cost of this item? Is it based on its construction, rarity, social value?
- **Life-based:** How does this item compare to my goals in life? Is this worth setting me aback in my financial milestones?

Reject your fear of missing out—instead, accept the habit of waiting and contemplating to protect you from you, keeping unnecessary purchases at bay.

The explosion of micro-trends have granted the new generation with the power to shape-shift on command. Countless personas are available through the swipe of a fingertip, ready to replicate through pre-packaged curations of clothing—outfits of pure symbolic potency—derived and detached from their cultural origins. The youth now have an overabundance of styles to sift through in the bins of days gone by, expediting their journeys to identity. Perhaps those who hold the title “The Lost Generation” should be reconsidered.

Despite its dispersion throughout fashion discourse and digital content, personal style is a positive catalyst for the sanitization of fashion fodder. However, personal style can never, and should never, be considered a tool for self-actualization. No matter how well your choice of jacket reflects your personality, or how your style progression over the years gives you the feeling that you’re one step closer to being ‘complete’, you’re not your wardrobe. You’re not the outfits you wear on your social media accounts. You’re not your fucking khakis.

You are beautiful in all of your virtues and flaws, and the moment you accept and love yourself for who are you, you’ll realize that you’ve been complete from the very beginning—even before your first steps into this journey we like to call personal style.
