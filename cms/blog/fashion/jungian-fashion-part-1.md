Seldom do we delve into the depths of our souls, where the gates to the divine await us all.

Along the journey of self-discovery, we often confront the darkest of qualities that we’ve neglected over the years. But when we push onward, we begin to realize that these exact qualities are what make up our very being. Such thoughts permeated my mind when I stepped, slow and steady, into The Old Slaughterhouse of Poznan, Poland.

Echoes of the abandoned factory carried a peculiar stench of hollow drywall, while metal rods that peeked through the rubble remained stained in a faded shade of red. Pigeon feathers flocked down the concrete ground, with death’s breath brushing them about, forming whispers that pranced atop fragile footprints made of dust.

I could imagine plump carcasses hanging from hooks that swayed throughout this facility—ripe for a salivated plucking. And yet, despite the horror from a now distant past, the slaughterhouse evoked a deep catharsis similar to entering Antwerp’s Cathedral of Our Lady. The mix of repulsion and fascination gave off a bittersweet sensation, as if I was on the cusp of discovering something profound about myself. We can recognize this same sensation through experiencing art, music, film, and perhaps most peculiarly, fashion.

Those familiar with artisanal fashion can draw parallels in philosophical inquiries between The Old Slaughterhouse and designer Carol Christian Poell. During his formative years, Poell’s adoptive father exposed him to leather-crafting through their family business; his creative trajectory deviated from traditional paths in fashion, aligning him more closely [with that of an industrial designer](https://www.instagram.com/p/C0UYWiSM3qL/?hl=en&img_index=1): “The most important thing to have as a fashion designer is your own point of view. I prefer the approach of an industrial designer focusing on single tailored pieces, fabric analysis and how texture relates to form.” However, despite his claims that [“aesthetics takes second place”](https://akaibu.co/blogs/library/carol-christian-poell-interview-by-domus-in-2009) in his work, artistic interpretations are not only inevitable, but necessary. In fact, Poell’s artistic expressions of the confrontation of opposing forces can be surmised through his presentations and design motifs.

For his Spring/Summer 2001 presentation, Poell invited industry professionals into a chilling space mirroring the presentation’s title: Three Refrigerated Cells. In the center of the first cell was an assortment of shirts, trousers and jackets, all of which hung above complementary footwear, forming a harmonious circle.

For his Spring/Summer 2001 presentation, Poell invited industry professionals into a chilling space mirroring the presentation’s title: Three Refrigerated Cells. In the center of the first cell was an assortment of garments — shirts, trousers and jackets — all of which hung above complementary footwear, forming a harmonious circle. Spectators paced around the offerings, taking note of their materials and construction—it’s only natural that their reactions of admiration were predictable and their expectations of the next cell pre-conditioned. But as they moved forward, the second cell revealed itself as an inconvenient truth to the first.

Although a perfect circle remained, what hung were not clothes to gaze upon, but carcasses wrapped in gauze, the very flesh from which the clothes were made.

_Sacred animals are manufactured into livestock,_
<br/>
_slaughtered and dismembered,_
<br/>
_ripped of their souls along with their skin,_
<br/>
_dyed black,_
<br/>
_stitched back into wearable monstrosities,_
<br/>
_repackaged as harmless commodities,_
<br/>
_purchased and worn for the occasional social outing._

If the first cell represented fantasy, and the second reality, the third was identity. In it sat a chair for the attendees, and facing the chair was a rectangular mirror, where they confronted the notion that we are all an essential step in this lifeless cycle. “I wanted people to look into the mirror, I wanted to ask them: Can you deal with it? How do you deal with it?”

The theme of confrontation reveals itself throughout all facets of Poell’s eponymous brand, from wearable restrictions (confrontation with the body through c-shaped trousers, severely altering the wearer’s movements) to aesthetic reflections (confrontation with the eye through titanium prostheses in garments resembling damaged joints, rubber drips mimicking the final drops of blood from slaughtered cows). Like the Old Slaughterhouse, Poell’s work commands us to focus on the internal; as such, we are forced to confront the parts of ourselves that we willfully neglect and repress.

In Jungian psychology, these parts culminate into what is referred to as “The Shadow.” Whether it be behaviors shunned by societal norms or aspects of ourselves that we’ve come to despise, all are harbored within the unconscious, their burdens unchained so as to not drown us from their sheer weight. However, as Carl Jung proposed through his teachings of individuation, keeping these qualities at bay only exacerbates psychic disarray. Upon deeper reflection, the Shadow and its nestled qualities do not stand in opposition to our existence, rather they are the interlocking force to our core being. Only when we acknowledge and integrate our shadows into our consciousness do we come closer to true self-realization:

“To confront a person with his shadow is to show him his own light… Anyone who perceives his shadow and his light simultaneously sees himself from two sides and thus gets in the middle… He knows that the world consists of darkness and light. I can master their polarity only by freeing myself from them by contemplating both, and so reaching a middle position. Only there am I no longer at the mercy of the opposites.” — Carl Jung, “Good and Evil in Analytical Psychology” in Civilization in Transition.

The Shadow seeps through our behaviors, projections, and dreams—the Old Slaughterhouse and Carol Christian Poell’s work being no exception to its manifestations. After revisiting the aforementioned spaces, presentations and design motifs, it becomes clear that we are not confronting art as mere spectators: we are, in fact, confronting ourselves, with art acting as vessels for projection. Their provocative aesthetics compel our disowned qualities to spring back into the mind’s eye, eager to be understood, embraced, and loved.
