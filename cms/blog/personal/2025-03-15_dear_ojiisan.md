Dear Ojiisan,

Before taking the flight to Paris, I took a look at the photo of you, Okaasan, and Michi more than usual. That photo was taken by meâ€”I was about 10 years old, in a restaurant in Paris. You have the goofiest smile on, holding your fork and knife up high, ready to chow down.

I was about to go to Paris for Paris Fashion Week, yet all I could think about was whether or not I'd understand you a little but more by being in this city. I think it's safe to say that perhaps your main source of inspiration is Paris...

<br/>
<br/>

The green benches broken in over the decades.
The decaying wooden doors down narrow side streets.
The abundance of people wearing scarves and smoking cigarettes while sitting at the outside spaces of cafes.

<br/>
<br/>

Moss on concrete,
antique statues,
rusted metal,
all only possible with the passing of time.

All of these things and more remind me of you; your personal style, your sense of curation in ornaments and architecture, the houses and stores you've built from scratch.

I miss you, I wish you were here so I could tell you about everything that's happened over the years and the things i've been trying so hard to build. I wish we could nerd over clotheswhile smoking cigarettes in front of a cafe in Paris.
