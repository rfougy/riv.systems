Dear Ojiisan,

Before my flight to Paris, I found myself glancing at the photo of you, Okaasan, and Michi. That photo was taken by me—I was about 10 years old—in a restaurant in Paris. You had the goofiest smile on, with your fork and knife held up high, ready to chow down. What makes this photo so special to me is that you never smiled in front of a camera.

I was about to fly to Paris for Paris Fashion Week, yet all I could think about was whether or not I'd be able understand you a little bit more by being in this city. I think it's safe to say now that Paris is your main source of inspiration...

<br/>
<br/>

Green wooden benches broken in over the years. Decaying doors scattered along narrow alleyways. Strangers wearing scarves and smoking cigarettes, sitting at outdoor café tables.

Moss on concrete, antique statues, rusted metal—only possible by the passing of time.

<br/>

All of these things and more remind me of you: your personal style, your sense of curation for your boutique, the café and houses in the countryside of Japan that you've built from scratch.

<br/>

I miss you. I wish you were still here so I could tell you about everything that's happened since you left and the things I've been trying so hard to build.

I wish we could nerd out over clothes, while we drink coffee and smoke cigarettes, in front of a café in Paris.
