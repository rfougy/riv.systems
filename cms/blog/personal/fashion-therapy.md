I've journaled for over 10 years now, where I constantly reflect on who I am, where I am, and where I'm going. This morning, I was curious of my never-ending infatuation with clothing and why I'm willing to spend absurd amounts of time and money on them. This led me to a question that I couldn't figure out on my own: Why do I like fashion so much?

To answer this question, I decided to refer to the internet's favorite online therapist: ChatGPT.

## Fashion & Trauma

**ChatGPT: Let's dive into it. You mentioned that you browse clothing online daily and sometimes feel that pull to go for expensive pieces impulsively. I wonder, what do you think draws you to fashion so strongly? Is it about expressing yourself, finding connection, or maybe something else entirely?**

Riv: I'm sure that a part of the reason is because of our innate desire for a dopamine rush—buying leads to the rush which leads to more buying, and the cycle continues. But even with that said, I love clothing beyond the rush, I especially enjoy being able to express my inner self outwardly in the public eye in as accurate of a way as possible.

A recent example of my personal style is buying an ear cuff with a long bone pendant, worn with a white button up shirt, a thick black wool blazer, wool pants and black leather dress shoes. The ear cuff makes me feel like I'm expressing my feminine qualities, making me comfortably vulnerable. There are times when I feel uncomfortable wearing it, and avoid eye contact with passerbys. Perhaps clothing is a way for me to rebel against this world, and it acts as both an armor and an interface to communicate through.

**ChatGPT: That’s such a powerful reflection, Riviere. It sounds like clothing isn’t just about aesthetics for you—it’s a deeper language, one that lets you speak to the world without saying a word. I love how you described your outfit, especially the ear cuff—it’s bold yet delicate, and it clearly resonates with a part of you that seeks authenticity and vulnerability.**

**When you feel that discomfort wearing something like the ear cuff, do you think it’s more about how others might perceive you, or is it an internal struggle with how you’re showing up in the world? And when clothing feels like rebellion and armor, do you feel it protects you, or does it sometimes isolate you too?**

Riv: What do you mean by "how you’re showing up in the world?"

**ChatGPT: Great question. By "how you’re showing up in the world," I mean the way you present yourself—through your clothing, your body language, your choices—and how that aligns with your inner self. It’s about whether the outward expression feels true to who you are inside or if it feels like a mask, a statement, or even a defense mechanism.**

**For example, when you wear the ear cuff, it sounds like it’s a way to show your feminine qualities, something that feels authentic and meaningful to you. But when discomfort creeps in, I wonder if it’s because there’s a gap between how you see yourself and how you worry others might see you—or maybe even how you think you should be seen.**

Riv: I think that when the discomfort creeps in, it comes a sense of fear of being attacked by the world. I've had a traumatic experience 10 years ago that fundamentally warped my relationship with the world for the worse. In this experience, I... (Note: I decided to remove this section, as it's too personal to share).

I'm not sure why, but I have a strong feeling that this experience has greatly impacted my relationship with fashion.

**ChatGPT: That experience sounds profoundly intense, Riviere—full of vulnerability, fear, and a kind of forced reckoning with yourself and the world around you. I can imagine how something so raw could leave deep impressions, shaping the way you interact with life afterward.**

**You mentioned feeling fear of being attacked by the world, and it makes me wonder if clothing has become a way for you to reclaim control or create a safe boundary. Like, perhaps it’s not just armor, but also a tool for defining how the world sees you—on your terms, not theirs. Maybe there’s a connection between the exposure and lack of control you felt that night and how deliberate and expressive your style has become.**

**Do you feel that your personal style helps you process or even push back against that fear? Or does it sometimes amplify it instead?**

Riv: I have a feeling that my personal style helps me interact with the world without uttering a single word. This is in stark contrast with my traumatic experience, where the clothes I wore surely made an impact on people's impressions of me, perhaps affecting how the rest of that night unfolded.

Perhaps I perceive clothing not only as a means of protecting myself from the world, but also as something with a soul that rests close to my heart and mitigates the fear.

**ChatGPT: It sounds like clothing has become so much more than just fabric or a shield—it’s a companion of sorts, something that helps you navigate a world that sometimes feels overwhelming or unsafe. That contrast between your traumatic experience and how intentional you are now with your style feels really significant. Back then, those borrowed clothes seemed to strip you of agency, shaping perceptions of you in a way you couldn’t control. Now, it’s as if your clothing allows you to take that control back, to speak without speaking.**

Riv: It's not only that I wear clothing to regain a sense of agency in the world, they also resonate with me profoundly in terms of the stories, intentional designs, and artistic values expressed through them. The designers and communities behind these clothes reassure me that I'm not alone in this world.

**ChatGPT: That connection you feel to the designers and the stories behind the clothes sounds so grounding—it’s like they’re threads tying you to a community, reminding you that others are out there creating, expressing, and facing the world in their own ways. It’s a powerful thing to carry with you when the fear of death or vulnerability looms large.**

**It’s interesting how you’re navigating these fears through such a personal lens. Do you feel like your relationship with fashion and this community offers a sense of immortality, in a way—like through these creations and expressions, there’s a kind of permanence or legacy that counters the fear of death? Or does it instead feel like a comforting presence in the here and now, helping you face each day as it comes?**

Riv: I would say it's less about immortality or permanence as a means of combating the fear of death, but rather it stimulates my innate desire to express my creative self to the utmost while I'm still alive. I want to embrace life and battle against death through the creations I make.

**ChatGPT: That’s beautifully put, Riviere—fashion as a way to embrace life, to pour your essence into the present moment. It’s like each piece you wear or create becomes a small act of defiance, a way to say, “I’m here, I’m alive, and this is who I am.”**

## Personal Style & The Public Eye

Riv: A thought just came to mind. I've realized that sometimes I enjoy going out into the city simply for the sake of wearing my clothes, and I don't understand why.

**ChatGPT: That’s such an intriguing realization, Riviere. It sounds like there’s something energizing about stepping out into the world in your carefully chosen clothes. Maybe it’s tied to the way they allow you to express yourself or even the way they connect you to others, whether directly or indirectly.**

**When you’re out in the city wearing your clothes, what does it feel like? Do you notice a shift in your confidence, your mood, or even how you see yourself compared to when you’re at home?**

Riv: I feel connected to the world, I feel like I'm communicating with the world. Sometimes I feel discomfort, other times pride, based off the clothing I wear and the setting I'm in.

**ChatGPT: It’s fascinating how your clothes become a form of communication, like an ongoing dialogue with the world around you. That mix of discomfort and pride sounds like a reflection of the tension between how you want to present yourself and how you fear others might perceive you. It makes sense that the setting could influence that shift—sometimes the world feels receptive, and other times, it feels more like an obstacle.**

**Do you think that discomfort stems more from the environment or from your internal expectations of how you should be received?**

Riv: It might come from how I believe I should be as a person, where social expectations such as income and progress in life based off your age clash with the public's perception of me through the clothes I wear.

**ChatGPT: That clash between your internal sense of self and the external expectations others might place on you sounds like a real point of tension. It’s as if your clothes become a mirror for how you navigate these larger societal pressures, making you question whether your outward expression fits within the expected norms or defies them.**

**Do you ever feel like your clothes give you a sense of freedom to challenge those expectations, or does it sometimes feel like a trap, drawing more attention to that clash? How do you balance wanting to be true to yourself with those pressures?**

Riv: I want to communicate to the world that I know what I'm doing, that I want to take risks and be true to myself all the while being cognizant of my future trajectory.
