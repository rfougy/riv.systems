In the summer of 2019, I was asked by a fellow Bostonian to be featured in his magazine 'Sleepless'. During this time I was an avid reseller of Archive Fashion, and frankly had more articles of clothing than I can manage. It was from here where the lights clicked: "What if I used this opportunity to create an Archive Fashion editorial?" I decided to reach out to Layne, a friend who photographed for Bodega at the time, and from there we began to conceptualize the project.
