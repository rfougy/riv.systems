I’ve been extremely interested in [Acronym](https://acrnm.com/) over the past half year, and while browsing through the mother site I came across this ridiculously sick hairstyle. I just had to add it to the RIV.SYSTEMS as a reference, there’s just something so cool about having this pattern dyed on your hair while dressed in top-down black technical garments. Futuristic yet street, refined yet playful.
