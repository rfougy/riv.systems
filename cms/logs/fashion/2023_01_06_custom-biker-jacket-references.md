Creating a custom punk biker jacket from absolute zero is a task only few can take on. Hand-stitch a patch onto a sleeve or add in a few studs across the backside? Sure. But spend tens of hours to fill every empty portion of a piece to the brim? Most would shrug the challenge off: [“Forget ‘bout it!”](https://youtu.be/pS6zJ7IsJkM)

I’ve spent a total of 50+ hours customizing my biker jacket, and I’m not putting this out there as a means of bragging — you know what, maybe I am! But more importantly, the hours tallied is evidence enough of just how immersive creating a one-of-a-kind piece can be. The pride that comes with the craft is unexplainable. With that being said, customizing a jacket requires inspo from unique pieces created by fanatics like ourselves. "But where is Gods' tarnation can you actually find them?", you might ask (well maybe not, I just wanted to write 'what in God's tarnation' somewhere on this site).

Since starting my journey of DIY through this biker jacket, I’ve amassed a [collection of images](https://www.are.na/riviere-fougy/biker-jacket-8yzhrsdicgc) as references and inspiration. Those who created such pieces includes the likes of Bounty Hunter’s founder [Hikaru Iwanaga](https://youtu.be/cSgs-5bXCMg), the mysterious and obscure [Shiga from Japan](http://whev.com/actafp/), Japanese punk band [The Erections](https://www.infringe.com/the-erections/), and cult-brand [Blackmeans](https://www.archivepdf.net/post/brand-breakdown-yujiro-komatsu-and-blackmeans). The pieces are nothing short of DIY perfection, carefully curated with passion oozing out of every nook and cranny.
