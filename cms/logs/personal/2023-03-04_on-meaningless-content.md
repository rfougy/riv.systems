Every corner of the internet is packed to the brim with ‘meaningful’ content: content that provides novel information / an aesthetic that satisfies the senses / a point of view that you were never aware of. Heck, those ridiculous videos on TikTok also count — you know, the ones that seem meaningless yet considered meaningful because the number of likes and comments they attract.

I can’t help think that the current state of meaningful content is a byproduct of public reception. Each new piece of content receives feedback from its audience through likes, comments and shares. Whether aware of our own behavior or not, we give and take this feedback and use it to influence future content. Not only is public reception influential, but also content with large audiences and high levels of engagement. All of this leads to a saturated pool of similar voices, similar branding, and similar content. But what about _meaningless_ content?

To me, most TikTok videos in circulation are meaningless content. To you it might be poorly styled outfit photos on Instagram or motivational posts your connections share on LinkedIn. You get the gist. A piece of content we don’t find meaning in seems absurd, something that shouldn’t be created in the first place.

You can create meaningless content, in fact you _SHOULD_ create meaningless content. All too often do we convince ourselves that we’re not worthy of uploading content we’ve spend minutes, days, months on: “Will anyone care?”. If you’ve ever made content before, you know the feeling where your chest thumps moments before clicking the upload button, followed by obsessive check-ins on engagement. It’s a horrible toxic feeling, and should never be tolerated. Ever.

I’ve felt the exact same way posting through Instagram years ago. What started as a passion project slowly turned into an anxiety-induced obligation — spending hours to commute, take outfit photos and edit a post — only to be let down by its engagement and figure out how to improve for the next round. Rinse and repeat. The passion got lost in the midst of numbers and ‘online success’, and I slowly drifted away from what initially gave me pure joy. Luckily for me the passion to create content has remained just as strong as before, but this time I’m going to do it my way. Whether deemed meaningful by none or many, I’m going to create what I like, go at my own pass, and partake in one of the most fulfilling hobbies I’ve ever experienced in this life.

Whether meaningful or meaningless, if you’re making content because you want to, do it! If you feel that likes and comments are getting in the way of what you want to make, hide and disable them. At the end of the day you should create content because you simply want to, ‘cause there isn’t any other feeling than making what you want and seeing it manifest in this life.
