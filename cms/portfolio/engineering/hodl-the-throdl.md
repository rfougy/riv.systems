"Hodl the Throdl!" is <mark>a game where players collect coins and turn them into cryptocurrency via a local blockchain</mark>. After logging in, players navigate levels to gather coins, avoid obstacles and enemies, and earn credit for the coins collected. Players can <mark>convert coins to HODL coins, disburse funds to their MetaMask account, and buy characters for in-game use</mark>.

<br/>

## Features

For this project, I assumed the responsibility of <mark>spearheading the development of the game's cryptocurrency and integrating the app with Web3</mark>. This undertaking was indeed challenging, as it required me to navigate a steep learning curve and accomplish it <mark>within a 3 weeks</mark>. Nevertheless, I found the challenge deeply engrossing and immersive, as it compelled me to achieve <mark>mastery over the workings of this emerging technology</mark>.

A few of the core deliverables I contributed through this endeavor included:

<br/>

- Creation of the in-game cryptocurrency through the development of an ERC20 smart contract using the Solidity
- Compiling the smart contract and migrating it to our local blockchain network
- Integrating Web3 to our application, allowing access to the local blockchain and Metamask for token transactions
- Establishing the logic necessary for conversions between in-game currency and cryptocurrency, along with the purchasing of videogame characters

<br/>

In addition to leading this effort,I had a significant role in enhancing the user experience of the application by <mark>sourcing all videogame assets, developing character animations and designing the webapp’s UI</mark>.
