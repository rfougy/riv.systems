To create a custom punk biker jacket from absolute scratch is a task few can take on without a true passion for the craft. Hand-stitching a cute little patch on a sleeve or adding in a few studs across the backside? Sure. But to spend tens of hours to fill every empty portion of a piece to the brim? Most would shrug the challenge off, “Forget ‘bout it!”

I’ve spent 50+ hours working on my biker jacket over the years, and I’m not putting this out there as a means of bragging — you know what, maybe it is. But more importantly, it’s evidence of just how immersed you can become when creating a one-of-a-kind piece that you and you alone can take pride in. However, creating a custom jacket requires inspiration from unique pieces created by likeminded fanatics. But where in the tarnation can you actually find them? It’s rare to see a genuine custom punk biker jacket in the flesh nowadays. 

Since starting my journey of DIY through this biker jacket, I’ve amassed a [collection of images](https://www.are.na/riviere-fougy/biker-jacket-8yzhrsdicgc) as references and inspiration. Those who created such pieces including the likes of Bounty Hunter’s founder [Hikaru Iwanaga](https://youtu.be/cSgs-5bXCMg), the mysterious [Shiga from Japan](http://whev.com/actafp/), and [cult-brand Blackmeans](https://www.archivepdf.net/post/brand-breakdown-yujiro-komatsu-and-blackmeans). The pieces are nothing short of DIY perfection, carefully curated with passion oozing in every nook and cranny.
