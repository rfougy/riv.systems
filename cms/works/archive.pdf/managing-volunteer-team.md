Since its founding in 2019, [ARCHIVE.pdf](https://www.archivepdf.net/) has been pursued as a community-driven passion project. The company’s values and mission resonated within the fashion community, with fellow enthusiasts offering to volunteer and work together to realize its vision. By 2023, we had grown into <mark>a fully remote, volunteer-based team of 20</mark> — leaders, content creators, writers, developers — and together we were able to [achieve milestones that even well-funded, salaried teams could only dream of](https://riv.systems/content/works/archive.pdf/archivepdf-retrospective-part-1).

## What Makes a Volunteer-Based Team Different

Unlike salaried teams, where financial compensation serves as its foundations, volunteer-based teams lack this entirely. Because of this, <mark>the motivations behind joining, staying, and engaging within the team are almost always intrinsic</mark>. This can range from the desire to advance one’s career and skills, to wanting to make a meaningful impact within the community, to simply pursue a passion for the niche, or all of the above.

Another unique quality of volunteer-based teams is their <mark>ability to attract truly passionate individuals</mark>. Volunteering free time into a project, on top of the day-to-day responsibilities and obligations, is a commitment that only few are willing to make. And when a team is comprised entirely of such individuals, it creates a type of camaraderie and mutual respect that can't be replicated in traditional work environments.

Of course, volunteer-based teams don’t come without their challenges. The most common is <mark>taking into account the varying levels of commitment and fluctuating schedules</mark>. Members are offering their spare time, and so it only makes sense for this time to change in favor of competing priorities like job changes, family obligations, or educational pursuits.

The other challenge is member turnover. Although the majority of members have stayed for several years, <mark>there are moments when others are unable to continue and new members join in their place</mark>. This is only natural—without financial compensation as a reason for staying, competing priorities can make it difficult to maintain volunteer commitments.

## Management Style for Volunteer Teams

The following approaches can be found in traditional work environments, however I’d argue that the essence of them diverge significantly when applied to volunteer-based teams.

### Heightened Attention to Individual Needs & Bandwidth

As mentioned earlier, people who volunteer are rare, and so <mark>it's essential to work as closely and meaningfully with them as possible</mark>. This includes having frequent one-on-one calls, direct collaborations on projects and goals, and growing real rapport. Of course, their individual bandwidths and priorities also need to be kept in mind in order to manage effectively and reach goals on a weekly basis. Instead of assuming that their availability will stay the same over a long period of time, it's crucial to check in with members regularly about their availability. <mark>Flexibility is also a key quality to have</mark>, where you should be prepared to adjust timelines, redistribute work, and pivot plans if availabilites shift.

### Celebrate Individual and Team Accomplishments

Foster <mark>a positive environment where managers and members alike acknowledge and celebrate each other’s work</mark>. From a new member’s first Instagram caption to a team project for a client, each accomplishment deserves recognition. This kind of culture strengthens team dynamics and encourages continued momentum, but more importantly, it’s fulfilling and validates that every member’s work is meaningful to both their team, the company's following, and the community at large.

Managing and being a part of a volunteer-based team is an experience like no other. The intrinsic motivations of every member, most of whom are passion-driven, creates a community of people who create work with genuine meaning and impact. I hope that managers in traditional work settings can draw from these observations — or better yet, experience them firsthand — and apply them to their own teams, changing relationships and collaborations for the better.
