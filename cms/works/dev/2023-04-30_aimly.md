I was fortunate enough to become the first frontend engineer to join Aimly's engineering team — <mark>later transitioning into a fullstack engineer</mark> — playing a pivotal role in <mark>establishing the foundations of the company's platform</mark>, both in terms of features and the architectural standards and practices of the frontend.

<br/>

## Features

Working alongside a talented and skilled product manager, full-stack engineer, backend engineer, DevOps engineer and UX/UI designer, we collaborated to construct the framework of <a href="https://www.goaimly.com/" target="_blank">Aimly's website</a>. Given the relatively small size of our team, it was <mark>critical to maintain open communications, efficient coordination, and exceptional agility</mark> in order to successfully execute our objectives.

Given the magnitude of the responsibilities entrusted to each member of our team, I was tasked with <mark>leading the development of numerous key deliverables</mark>. Such deliverables involved the technical design process, from creation and iteration of technical design documents, to strategy and discussions with the team, and eventual releases. <mark>Said deliverables include:</mark>

<br/>

- <a href="https://www.goaimly.com/create-new-event" target="_blank">Event Creation Flow</a>: Frontend Architecture, Validation Logic, Data Persistence
- 'Join a Team' Initiative: Fullstack Implementation of Team Events, Leaderboard Logic, Individual vs. Team Progress
- <a href="https://www.goaimly.com/event/MQ==" target="_blank">Shopping Cart Logic</a>
- <a href="https://www.goaimly.com/" target="_blank">Home Page</a>: Frontend Implementation, Page Optimization with Lighthouse
- Email Newsletter Subscriptions

<br/>

Other notable contributions include:

<br/>

- Home and Event Page Optimizations: Virtualization, Programmatic Image Compression via Backend, Lazy Loading Components
- Establishment and Automation of Cypress Tests via CI Pipeline
- Dynamic Open Graph and SEO
- Emoji Encryption and Decryption
- Refactoring Pages to Utilize NextJS Data Fetching

<br/>

## Establishing Standards and Best Practices

One of my proudest and most significant contributions to Aimly were the <mark>foundational standards and practices implemented across the frontend codebase</mark>. The CSS Style Guide, in particular, has had a profound impact on all client-facing pages and components, serving as a consistent point of reference, revisitation, and revision as the codebase continues to expand in size and complexity.

Some of the <mark>core principles that were considered in its development include:</mark>

<br/>

- Which CSS methodologies to prioritize and reasoning behind such decisions
- The emphasis on maintaining a central theme file to store global values and base component styles
- The incorporation of standards and practices in relation to our chosen UI component library

<br/>

## UX/UI Design

One of the benefits of working at Aimly was the <mark>opportunity to wear multiple hats</mark>. Throughout my time there I have taken the initiative to <mark>spearhead several key designs</mark>, all involving UX research, lofi and hifi wireframing, and documentation. These include the event page layout (row to column-based approach, donation section and modal), Aimly Variety Pack (event page prompt, product page), and order summary page.
