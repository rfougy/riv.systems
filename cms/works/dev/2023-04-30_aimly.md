I was fortunate enough to become the first frontend engineer to join Aimly's engineering team, playing a pivotal role in establishing the foundations of the company's platform, both in terms of features and the architectural standards and practices of the frontend.

<br/>

## Features

Working alongside a talented and skilled product manager, full-stack engineer, backend engineer, and DevOps engineer, we collaborated to construct the framework of <a href="https://www.goaimly.com/" target="_blank">Aimly's website</a>. Given the relatively small size of our team, it was critical for us to maintain open communication, efficient coordination, and exceptional agility in order to successfully execute our objectives.

Given the magnitude of the responsibilities entrusted to each member of our team, I was tasked with numerous key deliverables, including:

<br/>

- <a href="https://www.goaimly.com/create-new-event" target="_blank">Event Creation Flow</a>
- <a href="https://www.goaimly.com/event/MQ==" target="_blank">Shopping Cart Logic</a>
- Event Date Time Logic Across Timezones
- Emoji Encryption and Decryption
- Establishment of Cypress Tests and Integration with the CI Pipeline

<br/>

Furthermore, I was proud to have led the development of <a href="https://www.goaimly.com/" target="_blank">Aimly's homepage</a>, from the initial stages of discovery, the the iterative research process, coordination with my fellow team, and final execution.

## Establishing Standards and Best Practices

One of my proudest and most significant contributions to Aimly were the foundational standards and practices that were implemented across the frontend codebase. The CSS Style Guide, in particular, has had a profound impact on all client-facing pages and components, serving as a consistent point of reference, revisitation, and revision as the codebase continues to expand in size and complexity.

Some of the core principles that were considered in its development include:

<br/>

- Which CSS methodologies to prioritize and reasoning behind such decisions
- The emphasis on maintaining a central theme file to store global values and base component styles
- The incorporation of standards and practices in relation to our chosen UI component library
