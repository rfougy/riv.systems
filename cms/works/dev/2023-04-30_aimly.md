I was fortunate enough to <mark>become the first frontend engineer</mark> to join Aimly's engineering team — later transitioning into a fullstack engineer — playing a pivotal role in establishing the foundations of the company's platform, both in terms of features and the architectural standards and practices of the frontend.

<br/>

## Features

Working alongside a talented and skilled product manager, full-stack engineer, backend engineer, DevOps engineer and UX/UI designer, we collaborated to construct the framework of <a href="https://www.goaimly.com/" target="_blank">Aimly's website</a>. Given the relatively small size of our team, it was critical for us to maintain open communication, efficient coordination, and exceptional agility in order to successfully execute our objectives.

Given the magnitude of the responsibilities entrusted to each member of our team, I was tasked with leading the development of numerous key deliverables. Such deliverables involved the technical design process, from creation and iteration of technical design documents, to strategy and discussions with the team, and eventual releases. Said deliverables include:

<br/>

- <a href="https://www.goaimly.com/create-new-event" target="_blank">Event Creation Flow</a>: Frontend Architecture, Validation Logic, Data Persistence
- 'Join a Team' Initiative: Fullstack Implementation of Team Events, Leaderboard Logic, Individual vs. Team Progress
- <a href="https://www.goaimly.com/event/MQ==" target="_blank">Shopping Cart Logic</a>
- <a href="https://www.goaimly.com/" target="_blank">Home Page</a>: Frontend Implementation, Page Optimization with Lighthouse
- Email Newsletter Subscriptions

<br/>

Other notable contributions include:

<br/>

- Home and Event Page Optimizations: Virtualization, Programmatic Image Compression via Backend, Lazy Loading Components
- Establishment and Automation of Cypress Tests via CI Pipeline
- Dynamic Open Graph and SEO
- Emoji Encryption and Decryption
- Refactoring Pages to Utilize NextJS Data Fetching

<br/>

## Establishing Standards and Best Practices

One of my proudest and most significant contributions to Aimly were the foundational standards and practices that were implemented across the frontend codebase. The CSS Style Guide, in particular, has had a profound impact on all client-facing pages and components, serving as a consistent point of reference, revisitation, and revision as the codebase continues to expand in size and complexity.

Some of the core principles that were considered in its development include:

<br/>

- Which CSS methodologies to prioritize and reasoning behind such decisions
- The emphasis on maintaining a central theme file to store global values and base component styles
- The incorporation of standards and practices in relation to our chosen UI component library

<br/>

## UX/UI Design

One of the benefits of working at Aimly was the opportunity to wear multiple hats. Throughout my time there I have taken the initiative to spearhead several key designs, all involving UX research, lofi and hifi wireframing, and documentation. These include the event page layout (row to column-based approach, donation section and modal), Aimly Variety Pack (event page prompt, product page), and order summary page.
