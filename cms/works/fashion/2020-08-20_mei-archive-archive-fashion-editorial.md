Back when I was immersed in the Archive Fashion niche, I found myself connecting with likeminded enthusiasts both online and in the Greater Boston area. One such enthusiast was Eagle Li, co-founder of [Mei Archive](https://www.instagram.com/mei_archive/?hl=en), an Archive Fashion store and rental service.

In the midst of a hot summer day, the both of us decided to create editorial content featuring Mei’s collection of high quality and hard-to-find garments. The result was a youthful, organic, and energetic take on the niche genre of fashion.
